ATM Simulation System in C

This project simulates the functionality of a basic ATM system using the C programming language. It offers users the ability to perform typical banking operations such as:

Balance Inquiry: Users can view their current account balance.
Cash Withdrawal: Users can withdraw money from their account, provided they have sufficient funds.
Cash Deposit: Users can deposit a specified amount into their account.
Pin Change: Users can update their ATM PIN for added security.
Transaction History: Optionally, users can view their recent transactions for reference.
Key Features:

User Authentication: The system requires users to enter a correct PIN to access their account.
Error Handling: Includes error checking for invalid inputs, insufficient funds during withdrawals, and maximum withdrawal limits.
Menu-Driven Interface: The program features a simple text-based interface where users can choose operations from a menu.
Security Measures: After three incorrect PIN attempts, the system locks the user out.
